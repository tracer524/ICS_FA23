\section{Program Design}
The structure of the program is shown in the following figure. 
The function TERM stands for TERMination.

\end{figure}

Here is the details of the function VERIFY. It reads a character each time and
compare it to the corresponding character in the password. 
If an unmatching character is found or the length of input
exceeds the password. The indicator(i.e. \lstinline{R0}) is set negative.

\section{Discussion Questions}
\subsection{Functions}
Several functions are used in the program. Reasons:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Some part of the program may be executed more than once.
  \item The use of functions increases readability and makes debugging easier.
\end{enumerate}
\subsection{Recursion}
Recursive functions can be used in the program for checking password. But due to the simplicity of the process
(10-character password and 3 attempts), I chose not to use them. 

Also, the use of recursion to check password may have a problem when input is 
super long.

Actually attempts and preparations to use recursion was made.
\subsection{Preset Prompts}
In this program, only 3 attempts are allowed, which means prompts are not too many. 
In order to keep developing process simple, all prompts are stored using \lstinline{.STRINGZ}
, rather than combine prompts for incorrect inputs, which is a resonable approach if number of attempts allowed may be modified.
\begin{lstlisting}
  INITPRPT      .STRINGZ    "Welcome to the bank system! Type 'W' to withdraw some fund."
  SUCCPRPT      .STRINGZ    "Success!"
  FAILIPRPT     .STRINGZ    "Incorrect password! 2 attempts remaining."
  FAILIIPRPT    .STRINGZ    "Incorrect password! 1 attempt remaining."
  FAILIIIPRPT   .STRINGZ    "Fails."
  INPUTPRPT     .STRINGZ    "Please input your password:"
  PSWD          .STRINGZ    "PB22151743"
\end{lstlisting}
\subsection{Program Security}
There are two kinds of inputs worth considering: empty input and long input.

In this program, the length of input won't cause a problem. 
Every time a character is read by the program, it's immediately
checked. If the input is longer than the password or a wrong character is found, 
the indicator will be kept negative. 

As for the empty input, A register is set to mark the first character. 
If the first character is Y, the indicator will be nagative.

\subsection{Challenges}

An error occured when I tried to assemble the program, which I had
never met before:
\begin{figure}[H]
    \centering
    \includegraphics[scale=0.3]{Error1.png}
    \caption{An error}
\end{figure}

The same instruction worked well in Lab4, which baffled me. Later I realized what 
the message means: PCoffset was too large. 

Solution: move the instruction up.
